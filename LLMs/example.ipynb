      "Reasoning trace example:\n",
      "Okay, I need to multiply 7271 by 861 manually. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that multiplying large numbers manually involves breaking them down by each digit of the smaller number, multiplying each part by the larger number, and then adding up the results. Let me verify which number is smaller. 7271 is a four-digit number, and 861 is a three-digit number, so I'll use 861 as the multiplier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking down 861 into its individual digits: 8 (hundreds place), 6 (tens place), and 1 (ones place). So I need to compute three separate products and then sum them up with appropriate shifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the ones place: 1 × 7271. That should be straightforward. 1 times any number is the number itself, so that's 7271.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is the tens place: 6 × 7271. Let me calculate that. Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "6 × 7000 = 42,000\n",
      "\n",
      "6 × 200 = 1,200\n",
      "\n",
      "6 × 70 = 420\n",
      "\n",
      "6 × 1 = 6\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding those together: 42,000 + 1,200 = 43,200; 43,200 + 420 = 43,620; 43,620 + 6 = 43,626. So the tens place gives 43,626, but since it's the tens place, I need to add a zero at the end, making it 436,260. Wait, no. Wait, the tens place is the second digit from the right, so when multiplying by the tens digit (6), the result should be shifted one place to the left, which is equivalent to multiplying by 10. So 43,626 × 10 = 436,260. Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the hundreds place: 8 × 7271. Let's compute that step by step as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "8 × 7000 = 56,000\n",
      "\n",
      "8 × 200 = 1,600\n",
      "\n",
      "8 × 70 = 560\n",
      "\n",
      "8 × 1 = 8\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding those up: 56,000 + 1,600 = 57,600; 57,600 + 560 = 58,160; 58,160 + 8 = 58,168. Since this is the hundreds place, we need to shift it two places to the left, which is multiplying by 100. So 58,168 × 100 = 5,816,800.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, sum all three parts: 7,271 (ones) + 436,260 (tens) + 5,816,800 (hundreds). Let me add them one by one.\n",
